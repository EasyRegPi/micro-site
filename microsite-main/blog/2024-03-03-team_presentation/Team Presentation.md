During the development of our application we spread the work to be done by sprints. Each sprint had a duration of 1/2 weeks (except the first one) and at the end of each sprint we had a meeting to discuss the work done and the work to be done in the next sprint.

The distribution made is listed below:

| Sprint | Scrum Master        | Product Owner       | Developers                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Hugo Correia        | Duarte Cruz         | Alexandre Cotorobai, Bernardo Figueiredo, Joaquim Rosa, Andr√© Oliveira |
