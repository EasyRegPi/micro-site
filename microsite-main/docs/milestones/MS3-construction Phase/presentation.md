## User Interface

**Full Apresentation** - [MS3 - EasyReg](../../../static/ppt/EasyRegMS3.pptx)

The User Interface of EasyReg is responsible for managing all interactions between users and the system, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience. Built with React.js, it leverages a component-based architecture to provide a dynamic, responsive, and scalable frontend.

Authentication is handled via Keycloak, allowing secure login and role-based access through token validation, without the need to implement custom auth logic.

Recent updates introduced key features such as:

    Interactive dashboards for browsing frameworks and controls,

    A policy viewer with structured HTML rendering,

    Project and tenant creation flows 


These enhancements improve both usability and functionality, aligning the interface with the platformâ€™s compliance goals.
